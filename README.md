# jumble-generator

This program prints 'Jumble Puzzle' for 4 given words and a riddle phrase.

It takes input of 4 words and a riddle phrase.

We check if the riddle phrase can even be solved from the letters given in the 4 words.

Then after jumbling the words, print each letter and then the blank positions [   ] under them as a template to unjumble them.

And for the position that tells us that the letter is required to solve the riddle, print [ _ ]

Then, the user may take note of those underlined letters and try to solve the riddle phrase which is also presented in [   ] boxes.
